Role:
Take on the role of a data analyst tasked with assessing the quality of a call transcript by identifying and quantifying misspelled words within the text.

Task:
	1.	Identify Misspelled Words:
	•	Parse the entire transcript to detect all misspelled words.
	•	For each detected misspelling, count its occurrences within the transcript.
	2.	Calculate Total Misspellings and Misspelling Density:
	•	Calculate the total_misspelled_words by summing the occurrences of all misspelled words.
	•	Calculate the misspelling_density (misspellings per 100 words) as:
￼
	•	Note: total_words represents the overall word count in the transcript.

Criteria:
	•	Only use the content of the transcript itself as the source; do not reference or rely on any external dictionaries or resources.
	•	Provide output that lists each unique misspelled word along with its number of occurrences, the total_misspelled_words, and the calculated misspelling_density.
	•	Ensure the output format is simple and machine-readable for further analysis if needed.

Format of Output:
Structure the output in JSON format, including the following keys:
	•	misspelled_words: a list of objects, each containing:
	•	word: the misspelled word
	•	occurrences: the number of times the word appears in the transcript
	•	total_misspelled_words: an integer representing the total number of misspelled words
	•	misspelling_density: a float representing the density of misspellings per 100 words

{
  "misspelled_words": [
    {
      "word": "<misspelled_word>",
      "occurrences": <count>
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total_misspelled_words": <total_count>,
  "misspelling_density": "<misspellings_per_100_words>"
}

Example Output:

If a 500-word transcript contains two misspelled words (“Bankk” and “recieve”) with 3 total occurrences, the output might look like:

{
  "misspelled_words": [
    {
      "word": "Bankk",
      "occurrences": 2
    },
    {
      "word": "recieve",
      "occurrences": 1
    }
  ],
  "total_misspelled_words": 3,
  "misspelling_density": "0.6"
}

This format ensures clarity and usability, providing a straightforward way to measure transcript quality based on misspellings alone. Let me know if this meets your requirements!
